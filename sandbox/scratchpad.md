### Next steps


### Potential ideas

- Change years to period in Asset class (and use datetime objects to allow for monthly periods)
- Add flag to invest uniformly during the period
- Add incorrect and edge cases to test for generic asset class
- Add taxes calculations to asset
	- Generic asset always assumes no taxes and sub-classes introduce taxes?
- Add possibility of adding investment costs (at sub-class level?)
- Add possibility of calculating IRR pre and post costs
