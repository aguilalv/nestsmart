### Next steps

- Package proprerly and upload set-up github project
- Set-up UQPy Monte Carlo simulation

### Potential ideas

- Add incorrect and edge cases to test for generic asset class
- Add taxes calculations to asset
	- Generic asset always assumes no taxes and sub-classes introduce taxes?
- Add possibility of adding investment costs (at sub-class level?)
- Add possibility of calculating IRR pre and post costs
