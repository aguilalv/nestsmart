### Next steps


### Potential ideas

- Add possibility to calculate capital gains tax too
- Change quantities from float to a type that has units and can convert between units (try to remember the library)
- Add flag to invest uniformly during the period
- Add incorrect and edge cases to test for generic asset class
- Add taxes calculations to asset
	- Generic asset always assumes no taxes and sub-classes introduce taxes?
- Add possibility of adding investment costs (at sub-class level?)
- Add possibility of calculating IRR pre and post costs

### Potential technologies / services to use

- Use PostHog to understand how users use the site/app, to run releases to selected groups, to run post usage surveys ...
- https://katalon.com/ for automated testing
